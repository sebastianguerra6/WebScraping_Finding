<p class="Normal">The purpose of this NOSI is to encourage research on the efficacy of interventions that address nutrition security and the mechanisms of food insecurity on a variety of health outcomes.<br/>
It also calls for the development of new measures for nutrition security and assessment of food insecurity that are broadly applicable. . It was developed by the <a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/onr">Office of Nutrition Research</a> (ONR) Implementation Working Group on <a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/onr/iwg/nutrition-health-disparities">Nutrition and Health Disparities</a> in collaboration with NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) and Offices in support of the goals and objectives of the <a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/onr/strategic-plan">Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research</a>.</p>
<p class="heading4"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="Normal">Imagine a world without hunger, in which all individuals, families, and communities have ready access to enough affordable, nutritious food to sustain a happy and healthy life. The goal is urgent with levels of hunger, worsened by a weak supply chain that restricts access of nutritious food to underserved populations. The result is a rising incidence of food and nutrition insecurity, which like hunger, stems from many factors beyond food and aligns with lack of access to life-enhancing resources.</p>
<p class="Normal">Food insecurity   defined as the lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life   is a major public health concern and was exacerbated due to high rates of unemployment and reduction in work hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, the United States Department of Agriculture reported that 13.8 million US households (approximately 10.5 percent of all US households) experienced food insecurity. Food insecurity is inextricably linked to poverty, with 35.3 percent of households with a household income to poverty ratio under 1 being food insecure. Moreover, household food insecurity affected 14.8 percent of households with children and was particularly high in households headed by Black (21.7 percent) or Hispanic (17.2 percent) individuals. Food insecurity has also been noted as a concern for additional subgroups such as the aging population, those that experience disabilities, and American Indian/Alaska Native communities. Related is the concept of nutrition security, which is defined as having consistent access, availability, and affordability of foods and beverages that promote well-being and prevent (and if needed, treat) disease, particularly among racial/ethnic minority populations, lower income populations, and rural and remote populations including Tribal communities and insular areas (USDA). This term is less documented in the research literature and there is no validated measure to assess nutrition security. This is therefore an opportunity for future research.</p>
<p class="Normal">Food insecurity is related to suboptimal and/or poor diet quality, which increases chronic disease risk among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Several cross-sectional studies have shown that food insecure adults have lower nutrient intakes and lower Healthy Eating Index scores compared with secure food adults, especially among those with lower incomes. Consequently, food insecurity is associated with increased risk for nutrition-related negative outcomes, such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, heart disease, and some cancers. Although this association has been examined in the literature, the biological mechanisms are still poorly understood. In addition, there are major gaps in the literature on effective interventions that could mitigate the effects of food insecurity. Therefore, it is important to increase our understanding regarding the influence of food insecurity on the onset and progression of chronic diseases.</p>
<p class="Normal">Nutrition security and equitable access to healthy and affordable food in the U.S. are public health concerns. According to the USDA, approximately 13.5 million people in the U.S. have limited access to supermarkets or large grocery stores impacting access to healthy foods. Research shows higher diet quality is associated with proximity to and density of food stores, neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and perception of healthy food environments, especially for racial and ethnic minority populations. Food environments, such as lack of access to grocery stores and the presence of fast food restaurants at the neighborhood level, are associated with increased risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer survival. Elucidating the role of these social and environmental conditions on diet and nutritional status could help to prevent and manage diet-related health disparities and promote health equity. This is therefore an opportunity for future research to advance nutrition equity, including the broad categories below:</p>
<ol>
<li class="Normal">Development and testing of interventions, innovative programs, and natural experiments to address food insecurity and neighborhood-level access to healthy and affordable foods;</li>
<li class="Normal">Research to understand the mechanisms and pathways between food insecurity and neighborhood food environments on wellbeing and health and various health outcomes; and</li>
<li class="Normal">Studies to develop and validate tools to measure nutrition insecurity and food insecurity.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Normal"><strong>Some examples of appropriate studies include, but are <i>not limited to</i>, the following:</strong></p>
<p class="Normal"><u>Development and testing of interventions, innovative programs, and natural experiments</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Normal">Research to test innovative or existing interventions, programs, policies designed to positively affect the availability, access, and affordability of nutritious foods and healthy diets for populations who experience health disparities and vulnerable groups (e.g., minority populations, rural communities, older adults, children/youth and those with special needs, or disabled individuals) in multiple settings;</li>
<li class="Normal">Research to examine the effectiveness of "Food as Medicine  initiatives that include produce prescription programs, medically tailored meals, and integration of nutrition programs in the healthcare setting;</li>
<li class="Normal">Evaluation of multi-level, multicomponent interventions designed to reduce nutrition and food insecurity through improvements to neighborhood/community the food environment (e.g., new grocery stores, community markets, or food pantries) and their impact on health outcomes, with those that explicitly consider health equity and the social determinants of health;</li>
<li class="Normal">Natural experiment research to examine the impact of policies related to the social determinants of health (e.g., minimum wage increases or  living wages , child tax credit) on food insecurity and health outcomes;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal"><u>Identification of key risk factors and mechanistic pathways through epidemiological research</u></p>
<ul>
<li class="Normal">Mechanistic studies exploring the biological and behavioral mechanisms and pathways underpinning the influence of food insecurity on cancer, diabetes, and cardiometabolic disease, including key risk factors (e.g., obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol, and inflammatory markers);</li>
<li class="Normal">Research to understand the influence of food insecurity on disease prevention, management and progression, including for cancer, HIV, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease;</li>
<li class="Normal">Examination of the health effects of the intersectionality between household food insecurity and the social determinants of health (e.g., housing or transportation insecurity) as a factor underlying health disparities;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="Normal">Studies to investigate barriers to nutrition security including social, organizational (e.g., food retail practices, marketing), and policy factors and their role in shaping health outcomes and reducing health disparities;</li>
<li class="Normal">Examination of how climate change and extreme weather-related disasters affects food production and availability, access, quality, utilization, and stability of food systems.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal"><u>Development, validation, and evaluation of tools to measure food insecurity and nutrition security</u></p>
<ul>
<li class="Normal">Evaluation of novel approaches to screen for and address food insecurity within the healthcare settings (clinical and community settings) in individuals with or at risk of chronic disease;</li>
<li class="Normal">Development of valid measurements for nutrition security to operationalize the various components of nutrition security including food access, quality, and affordability to maintain optimal health;</li>
<li class="Normal">Development of methodologies and alternative measures to characterize current food retail environments and consumer behavior, specific to nutrition security and access to healthy, affordable food.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal">Interdisciplinary research teams (e.g., including behavioral scientists, nutrition researchers, academic physicians, economists, systems scientists, etc.) are encouraged.</p>
<p class="Normal">The Office of Nutrition Research (ONR) will convene annual virtual meetings which will serve as a forum to share study results, best practices for community engagement, and important lessons learned during the conduct of these studies. All awardees supported through this NOSI are encouraged to attend these annual virtual meetings and should so indicate in the cover letter.</p>
<p class="Normal">Non-responsive applications will not be reviewed and will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.</p>
<p class="Normal">Applicants are strongly encouraged to reach out to the relevant scientific contacts to discuss whether their applications are responsive.</p>

<p class="Normal">NCI encourages applications that examine the role of individual and household food and nutrition insecurity, and the neighborhood food environment influences cancer risk and outcomes across the cancer control continuum. Applications that focus on testing the efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation of multilevel interventions to mitigate and address the impact of food and nutrition insecurity in eliminating health disparities and reducing inequalities are encouraged. Additionally, NCI encourages interventions to assess barriers, facilitators, and costs to inform dissemination and equitable reach, delivery, and implementation across populations. NCI also encourages systems epidemiology approaches that incorporate high-dimensional measurements from multiple domains, assess interconnections and feedback loops between risk factors, and consider changes over time, utilizing advanced statistical methods, computational modeling, or simulations. NCI is interested in applications that develop, validate, and evaluate new methodologies, measures, and novel approaches to assess food and nutrition insecurity in health disparity populations and other understudied groups, including screening and risk assessment tools in cancer care delivery settings. Additionally, applications that assess how household food and nutrition insecurity influences mechanisms and pathways that worsen cancer treatment and cancer care management are of interest. NCI is interested in the contextual examination of programs and policy interventions at organizational, community, state, and federal levels that evaluate factors including access, availability, affordability, and acceptability to support healthy food environments to promote cancer prevention and control. NCI encourages applications in partnership with historically underserved communities experiencing cancer health disparities.</p>

<p class="Normal">NIMH will support research with human subjects or deidentified existing datasets. No research using vertebrate subjects or model systems will be considered. NIMH’s interests in this FOA include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p class="Normal"><b>Translational Research</b></p>
<ul>
<li class="Normal">Mechanistic studies exploring the biological and behavioral mechanisms underpinning the influence of food insecurity on neurodevelopmental risk and resilience for psychopathology across the lifespan and across diverse populations.</li>
<li class="Normal">Studies examining the interactions of food insecurity and other social determinants of health (e.g., housing or transportation insecurity) as a factor underlying mental health disparities.</li>
<li class="Normal">Studies examining how food insecurity influences clinical care across the lifespan, including as a hidden factor influencing diagnosis or treatment efficacy.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal"><b>Interventions Development and Services Research</b></p>
<ul>
<li class="Normal">Efficacy studies that examine how moderators related to food insecurity influence novel or established psychosocial/pharmacological interventions as they relate to both mechanisms of mental disorders (cognitive, attention, memory, etc.) and clinical outcomes</li>
<li class="Normal">Natural experiment research that examines the mechanisms through which policies related to the social determinants of health (e.g., minimum wage increases or  living wages , child tax credit; guaranteed incomes, housing vouchers) impact food insecurity and mental health outcomes</li>
<li class="Normal">Research to test innovative or existing interventions, programs, policies designed to positively affect the availability, access, and affordability of nutritious foods and healthy diets for populations who experience mental health disparities and vulnerable groups (e.g., minority populations, rural communities, older adults, children/youth and those with special needs, or disabled individuals) in multiple settings</li>
<li class="Normal">Mechanisms by which multi-level, multicomponent interventions designed to reduce nutrition and food insecurity through improvements to neighborhood/community the food environment (e.g., new grocery stores, community markets, or food pantries) impact mental health outcomes, with those that explicitly consider health equity and the social determinants of health</li>
<li class="Normal">Examinations of the downstream impact of policies and programs designed to mitigate the impact of food and nutrition insecurity on:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li class="Normal">Mental health service utilization (including preventive care, engagement with and adherence to mental health treatment, other self-management behaviors, quality of mental health care received)</li>
<li class="Normal">Mental health outcomes (e.g., suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety)</li>
<li class="Normal">The mechanisms by which addressing food insecurity affects mental health service utilization and/or outcomes.</li>

<p class="Normal"><b>HIV-related Research</b></p>
<ul>
<li class="Normal">Multi-level mechanistic studies examining the biological, behavioral, social, and structural interactions of food insecurity and other social determinants of health (e.g., housing or transportation insecurity) as a factor underlying HIV disparities both domestically as in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)</li>
<li class="Normal">Multi-level, multicomponent food insecurity interventions designed to improve mental health and HIV health outcomes, along with examination of change mechanisms</li>
<li class="Normal">Innovative intersectional insecurity (e.g., food, economic, and housing) approaches to reduce empirically documented disparities in HIV outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities and other marginalized and underserved groups including HIV-affected populations in LMICs.</li>

<li class="Normal">Research to assess and treat malnutrition due to food insecurity among migrants or displaced populations with a focus on children</li>
<li class="Normal">Research to understand the role of gender in the experience food insecurity</li>
<li class="Normal">Research to understand the role of climate change-driven events in food insecurity and biopsychosocial outcomes among migrants or displaced populations</li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal">For research on the effectiveness of interventions or services, NIMH supports studies that employ an experimental therapeutics approach, whereby clinical trials are designed not only to test the intervention effects on outcomes of interest, but also to inform understanding of the intervention’s mechanisms of action. As such, applications that propose to develop and/or test the efficacy/effectiveness of preventive, therapeutic or services interventions must include specification of the intervention target(s)/mechanism(s) and assessment of intervention-induced changes in the presumed target mechanism(s) that are hypothesized to account for the mental health intervention outcome. In the case of services interventions, targets/mechanisms might involve mutable consumer- or provider-behaviors, or organizational-/system-level factors that are intervened upon in order to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services.

<p class="Normal">The mission of the NIMHD is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. NIMHD focuses on all aspects of health and health care for racial and ethnic minority populations in the U.S. and the full continuum of health disparity causes as well as the interrelation of these causes. NIMHD projects must include a focus on one or more of the following populations that NIH-designates as experiencing health disparities in the United States and its territories: African Americans, Latinos/Hispanics, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, less privileged socioeconomic groups, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities. Comparison groups/populations may also be included as appropriate for the research questions posed. NIMHD encourages research projects that use approaches encompassing multiple domains of influence (e.g., biological, behavioral, sociocultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, family, peer group, community, societal) in food and nutrition insecurity to understand and address health disparities (see the NIMHD Research Framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for more information). Studies based outside the U.S. or its territories will not be supported by NIMHD.</p>

<p class="Normal">The Office of AIDS Research (OAR) is part of the NIH Office of the Director and works in partnership with the NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices in its coordination of the NIH HIV Research Program and to ensure that HIV/AIDS research is aligned with the <a href="https://www.oar.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH_StrategicPlan_FY2021-2025.pdf" target="_blank"><i>NIH Strategic Plan for HIV and HIV-Related Research</i></a>. Food insecurity influences HIV risk behaviors, prevention, and treatment. Inaccessibility to food and adequate nutrition impact uptake of HIV prevention strategies and technologies; uptake and adherence to HIV treatment, including anti-retroviral therapy; and HIV-related mortality. For these reasons, research to better understand and address the dynamics of food and nutrition insecurity in HIV prevention, treatment, and care are of interest. Examples of research of interest include interventions to improve food and nutrition contexts and dynamics in relation to the adoption, uptake, and maintenance of HIV prevention and/or treatment options and practices, including engagement with community programs and health care systems. This includes studies identifying how food and nutrition insecurity interact with biological and/or socio-behavioral mechanisms and pathways associated with HIV-related comorbidities and complications.</p>
<p class="Normal">OAR does not award grants but co-funds HIV-related applications and research projects that have received an award from one the participating NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) listed in the announcement.
