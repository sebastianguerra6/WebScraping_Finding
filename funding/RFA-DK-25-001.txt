					Funding Opportunity Purpose 
			</div>
<div class="col-md-8 datacolumn">
<p>This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites research projects that seek solutions to the development, exacerbation, and ineffective management of co-occurring conditions in marginalized communities of People with HIV (PWH). Projects must be based on a syndemics (synergistic epidemic) framework with a focus on the impact of racism, marginalization, discrimination, and/or stigma and their inter-relationships with social and structural risks. Projects may use mechanistic interventional approaches, policy/program evaluation studies, or epidemiology studies that build the evidence base to support improved equity and outcomes. The co-occurring conditions must be within the mission of NIDDK or NHLBI.</p><p>This NOFO requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP), which will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation. Applications that fail to include a PEDP will be considered incomplete and will be withdrawn. Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the NOFO instructions carefully and view the available PEDP <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/plan-enhancing-diverse-perspectives-pedp">guidance material</a>,</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Intersectional stigma and discrimination based on multiple factors - such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender identity - can result in greater marginalization and increased social risks, and can impact the management of comorbidities and co-infections in PWH across the lifespan. PWH often have multiple intersecting marginalized identities. For example, most new cases of HIV in the United States occur in gay and bisexual men and men who have sex with men (MSM) who are African-American/Black or Latino. African-American/Black women and transgender women are also disproportionately affected by HIV. In addition, other populations of PWH often experience marginalizing stigmas and challenges. These groups include, but are not limited to, sex workers, people involved with the justice system, young people experiencing homelessness without a guardian, older people, people with disabilities, rural residents, people living alone or in isolation, and people lacking access to health care.  Half of all PWH are aged 50 or older and experience specific challenges associated with aging. Access to health services is limited by socioeconomic status and geographical location, and young people experiencing homelessness without a guardian may also lack access to health care.  Moreover, there are often stigmas associated with co-occurring conditions as well as with HIV itself.  </p><p>Social determinants of health (SDoH) are the conditions in which people are born, grow, learn, work, play, live, and age, and the wider set of structural factors shaping the conditions of daily life. These structural factors include social, economic, and legal forces, systems, and policies that determine opportunities and access to high quality jobs, education, housing, transportation, built environment, information and communication infrastructure, food, and health care; the social environment; and other conditions of daily life.  For example, they could influence health-seeking behavior, retention in care, undergoing tests and procedures, or adherence to treatment regimens. How individuals and multiple communities of people with intersecting marginalized identities experience SDoH such as food, housing, and economic insecurity will vary.  Health behavior determinants can be operable at one or more levels of influence, including the PWH, caregiver/family, support circle, health care provider, healthcare system, and community levels.  Multiple interventions tailored to diverse lived experiences and populations are therefore needed. </p><p><strong>Objectives and Scope</strong></p><p>This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites projects that address the impact of SDoH on comorbidities and co-infections within populations that experience racism, marginalization, discrimination, or stigma. These include racial and ethnic minority groups as defined by U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), women, sexual minorities, gender minorities, and people with intersecting identities. It also invites projects focused on other key populations of PWH and other communities, such as, but not limited to, sex workers, people involved with the justice system, young people experiencing homelessness without a guardian, older people, people with disabilities, rural residents, people living alone or in isolation, and people lacking access to health care. Projects may address how SDoH impact the development or exacerbation of comorbidities or co-infections and/or how effective interventions alleviate comorbidities or co-infections and improve subsequent health or well-being.  The comorbidities and co-infections pursued must be within the mission of NIDDK and/or NHLBI.  </p><p>This initiative seeks mechanistic interventional approaches, inclusive of basic behavioral and social sciences research, policy/program evaluation studies and epidemiolical research toward advancing the understanding of syndemic interrelationships. Projects utilizing epidemiology approaches need to specify how the findings will build the evidence base to support action and improve outcomes for the relevant population. Additionally, this initiative could support dissemination and implementation (D&amp;I) research directed at addressing syndemics faced by PWH by utilizing multidisciplinary partnerships to identify the facilitators and barriers impacting access and adherence to prevention, care, and treatment. Furthermore, when evidence-based interventions exist, researchers and community partners can co-design appropriate strategies to promote the uptake of guideline-based care within vulnerable communities.</p><p>Because HIV-associated syndemic research requires strong transdisciplinary collaboration in the areas of HIV SDoH/epidemiology and various specialties relevant to the diseases and conditions under study among others (e.g., medical anthropology, sociology, health disapities/health equity, public health, and behavioral health), a multiple PD/PI format is required with at least one PD/PI with expertise in HIV syndemics and at least one PD/PI with expertise in the relevant condition(s) being addressed by the study.  Additional PDs/PIs may also be included if their expertise is critical to the success of the project.</p><p>Because this NOFO is being issued to address the need to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration between research communities, there is no expectation that the multiple PD/PI teams have a prior history of shared publications or otherwise evidence of extensive previous collaboration. The preliminary data, the rigor of the approach, and the Multiple PD/PI leadership plan can provide appropriate evidence of a strong and dedicated team engagement.</p><p>All aspects of the approach must be aligned with the guidelines outlined in <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-018.html">NOT-OD-20-018, UPDATE: NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities and Guidelines for Determining HIV/AIDS Funding. </a> In other words, all of the proposed research must be undertaken in the context of HIV/AIDS.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Designs of interest include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Community engaged research toward the development of interventions focused on communities of racial, ethnic, sexual, or gender minority communities.</li><li>Community engaged research toward the development of interventions focused on stigmatized populations such as sex workers or people involved with the justice system.</li><li>Community engaged research toward the development of interventions focused on communities with intersecting marginalized identities and stigmas.</li><li>Community engaged research focused on older people who are members of populations that experience racism, marginalization, or stigma. </li><li>Community engaged research focused on young people, including unhoused young people that are not accompanied by a parent.</li><li>Projects that evaluate the impact of policies or existing programs on populations that experience racism, marginalization, or stigma.  </li><li>Epidemiological approaches toward building the evidence base for the development of  interventions. </li></ul><p><strong>Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP)</strong></p><ul><li> This NOFO requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP) as described in <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-21-310.html">NOT-MH-21- 310</a>, submitted as Other Project Information as an attachment (see Section IV). </li><li> Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the NOFO instructions carefully and view the available <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/plan-enhancing-diverse-perspectives-pedp">PEDP guidance material</a>.

NIDDK encourages projects to use community engagement approaches in designing and implementing the proposed studies and to clearly describe the process they will use to facilitate meaningful sustainable collaboration with patients, caregivers, family members, community members, and other interested parties throughout the research process. Meaningful and equitable engagement should entail more than focus groups, surveys or other activities where affected people/communities are only involved as participants or respondents. </p><p

<p><strong>Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research</strong></p><p>Many NIH ICs encourage the use of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal" (<a href="http://cde.nih.gov/">http://cde.nih.gov/</a>) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.</p>

An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicants integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR Part 200.206 Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants. This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.</p>
